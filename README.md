## Getting Started

To fully utilize the code in this repository, you'll need an OpenAI API access token. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Visit the OpenAI website: https://openai.com/
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Navigate to the API section and create a new API key.
4. Copy your API key and keep it secure.

**Important:** Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control.

## Using Your API Key

Once you have your OpenAI API key, you can use it in the relevant parts of this project. Typically, you would set it as an environment variable:

```sh
export PRIVATE_OPENAI_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
